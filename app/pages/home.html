    <p class="Second-text">LightSB (Light Schrödinger Bridge) is an advanced machine learning solution designed to address optimal transport and complex system modeling. It specializes in mapping distributions with entropy regularization, making it a powerful tool for domain translation tasks.</p>
    <p class="Second-text">In this project, LightSB is used to learn a probabilistic mapping between two data distributions in a structured latent space. This enables controlled and diverse transformations between different domains. One specific application involves training latent representations to translate young faces into aged faces within the ALAE latent space.</p>
    <p class="Second-text">The Generator section of the project applies the trained model to new images, generating aged versions of faces based on learned transformations.
    <p class="Second-text">LightSB offers a fast and lightweight implementation of Schrödinger bridge algorithms, significantly accelerating task execution. It supports various data transport methods and can be used for image translation across different categories, for example, transforming high-resolution faces between genders (male to female) or age groups (adult to child).</p>
    <p class="Second-text">The LightSB project has gained recognition in the scientific community and has been presented at leading machine learning conferences such as ICML 2024 and ICLR 2024. Key publications include:</p>
